# Bash-Scripts
An automation of command-line tasks is extremely useful for a programmer in the process of learning C. Scripting(at least for me) also provides a different frame of 
reasoning towards the instruction of computers compared to other mathematical exercises, or even programming paradigms. This might sound overcomplicated, although the task of scripting can be interpreted(at least by me) among certain programmers as a level lower than imperative programming. The obvious level below imperative programming would be assembly language, although I infer command-line scripting can fare lower than imperative programming. More on this in the second commit.
